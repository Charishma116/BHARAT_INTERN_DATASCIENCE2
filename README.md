Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most well-known disasters in history, and by analyzing the passenger data, we can build a model to predict which passengers were likely to survive.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived or not. This dataset is widely used in data science and machine learning tutorials and competitions.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the Titanic dataset and predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

Methodology
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might be relevant for predicting survival, such as family size or extracting titles from passenger names.
Model Building: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to build predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on their attributes. This model could be used to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the disaster.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to analyze historical data and make predictions about real-world events. By building a predictive model for Titanic survival, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that determined survival rates during this tragic event.
